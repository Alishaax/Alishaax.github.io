 <p id="flying-angels"> WE ARE THE FLYING ANGELS</p>
<h1> ABOUT US</h1>
<p>The  Rosedale Rivers Basketball Team (Flying Angels) is a registered non-profit organization that is run, and coached, by unpaid volunteers.

We believe in putting athletes first and winning second.

Since 1996, we have placed Rosedale Rivers on the basketball map in Ontario by producing great basketball players and organizing completive tournaments.</p>
<h1>COACHING </h1>
<p>Our Coaches are dedicated to the development of our players’ skill level, as outlined in the series of publications (LTAD – Long Term Athlete Development) from Canada Basketball. This is accomplished through the use of our ‘Team Development Policy’ and by encouraging our coaches to continually improve their own knowledge of basketball by obtaining NCCP levels.</p>
