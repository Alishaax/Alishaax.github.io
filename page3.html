<h1> Rosedale Rivers STEM Department </h1>
<h2> What is STEM?</h2>
<p>You've likely heard the term STEM, but what does it stand for? STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering, and math. These four fields share an emphasis on innovation, problem-solving, and critical thinking. And together they make up a popular and fast-growing industry.
</p>

<h2> Why is STEM Important?</h2>
<p> The global economy is changing. Current jobs are disappearing due to automation and new jobs are emerging every day as a result of technological advances.

The continual advances in technology are changing the way students learn, connect and interact every day. Skills developed by students through STEM provide them with the foundation to succeed at school and beyond.

Employer demand for STEM qualifications and skills is high, and will continue to increase in the future. Currently, 75 per cent of jobs in the fastest growing industries require workers with STEM skills. To be competitive, the Australian workforce needs people who can adapt to a changing workplace.

STEM empowers individuals with the skills to succeed and adapt to this changing world.</p>

<h2>Teaching and Learning</h2>
<p>Rosedal Rivers Science teachers create teaching and learning activities<br> designed to meet the individual needs and learning styles of each student.<br> Many courses use project-based and inquiry-based learning approaches to<br> ensure all students are engaged and empowered to learn and succeed.</p>

<h2>What do we Expect?</h2>

<h3> Students?</h3>
<p>Students have many responsibilities with regard to their learning, and these increase as they advance through elementary and secondary school. Students who are willing to make the effort required, and who are able to monitor their thinking and learning strategies and to apply themselves, will soon discover that there is a direct relationship between this effort and their achievement, and will therefore be more motivated to work. Students who develop mental attitudes and ways of behaving that contribute to success in life will benefit as learners.</p>
<h3> Parents?</h3>
<p>Studies show that students perform better in school when their parents 1 are involved in their education. Parents who are familiar with the curriculum expectations know what is being taught in each grade and what their child is expected to learn. With such information, parents can better understand how their child is progressing in school and can work with teachers to improve their childâ€™s learning.</p>
<h2>Is STEM Worth it?</h2>
<p> A STEM high school curriculum prepares students for the future jobs that will involve a combination of math, science, and technology. STEM students graduate in better shape to find and keep a job because they have the knowledge, experience, and realistic expectations to succeed.</p>
