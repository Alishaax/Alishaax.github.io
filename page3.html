<h1> Rosedale Rivers Science Department </h1>
<h2> What ia Science?</h2>
<p>Science is both a body of knowledge and a process. In school, science<br> may sometimes seem like a collection of isolated and static facts listed<br> in a textbook, but that’s only a small part of the story. Just as importantly,<br> science is also a process of discovery that allows us to link isolated facts<br> into coherent and comprehensive understandings of the natural world.
