<h2> What is STEM?</h2>
<p>You've likely heard the term STEM, but what does it stand for? STEM<br> is an acronym for science, technology, engineering, and math. These<br> four fields share an emphasis on innovation, problem-solving, and critical<br> thinking. And together they make up a popular and fast-growing industry.
</p>

<h2> Why is STEM Important?</h2>
<p> The global economy is changing. Current jobs are disappearing due to<br> automation and new jobs are emerging every day as a result of technological<br> advances.The continual advances in technology are changing the way students<br> learn, connect and interact every day. Skills developed by students through<br> STEM provide them with the foundation to succeed at school and beyond.<br> Employer demand for STEM qualifications and skills is high, and will continue<br> to increase in the future. Currently, 75 per cent of jobs in the fastest growing<br> industries require workers with STEM skills. To be competitive. STEM <br>empowers individuals with the skills to succeed and adapt to this changing world.</p>

<h2>Teaching and Learning</h2>
<p>Rosedal Rivers Science teachers create teaching and learning activities<br> designed to meet the individual needs and learning styles of each student.<br> Many courses use project-based and inquiry-based learning approaches to<br> ensure all students are engaged and empowered to learn and succeed.</p>

<h2>What do we Expect?</h2>

<h3> Students?</h3>
<p>Students have many responsibilities with regard to their learning, and these<br> increase as they advance through elementary and secondary school. Students<br> who are willing to make the effort required, and who are able to monitor their<br> thinking and learning strategies and to apply themselves, will soon discover<br> that there is a direct relationship between this effort and their achievement, and<br> will therefore be more motivated to work. Students who develop mental<br> attitudes and ways of behaving that contribute to success in life will benefit as<br> learners.</p>

<h3> Parents?</h3>
<p>Studies show that students perform better in school when their parents are<br> involved in their education. Parents who are familiar with the curriculum<br> expectations know what is being taught in each grade and what their child<br> is expected to learn. With such information, parents can better understand<br> how their child is progressing in school and can work with teachers to<br> improve their childâ€™s learning.</p>
<h2>Is STEM Worth it?</h2>
<p> A STEM high school curriculum prepares students for the future jobs that<br> will involve a combination of math, science, and technology. STEM<br> students graduate in better shape to find and keep a job because they have<br> the knowledge, experience, and realistic expectations to succeed.</p>
